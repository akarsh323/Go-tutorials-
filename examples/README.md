# Go Basics Examples

One file per topic. Run examples using `go run`.

Examples:

```bash
cd examples
go run hello_world.go
# or run any file: go run <file>.go
```

Notes:
- Many examples intentionally avoid calls like `os.Exit` or causing `panic` during normal runs.
- If you'd like, I can convert these into subcommands or tests.
