Understanding WHY comes before understanding HOW.

### 3. **Examples Build Understanding**
Show → Explain → Test (let student try) → Reflect

### 4. **Progressive Mastery**
Master foundations → Combine concepts → Solve real problems

### 5. **Multiple Explanations**
Different minds need different approaches. Provide patterns, examples, and real-world applications.
