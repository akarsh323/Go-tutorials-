## 💡 Key Principles

### Learning
1. Understand **WHY** before HOW
2. Master **foundations** before advanced
3. **Experiment** boldly with code
4. **Break things** to learn from errors
5. **Teach others** to solidify understanding

### Teaching
1. Start with **motivation** (WHY)
2. Show **real applications** (REAL-WORLD)
3. Teach **progressively** (simple → complex)
4. Use **examples extensively**
5. Check **understanding frequently**

### Excellence
1. Clarity beats cleverness
2. Examples teach better than theory
3. Context comes before code
4. Practice matters more than reading
5. Understanding beats memorization

## 📞 FAQ

### How long does the course take?
- **Per topic:** 45-90 minutes
- **Per week:** 4-5 topics = 4-7 hours
- **Full course:** 8-12 weeks (1-2 hours daily)

### Do I need to do topics in order?
**Yes.** Each topic builds on previous ones. The sequence is carefully planned.

### Can I skip topics?
**Not recommended.** Later topics assume knowledge from earlier ones. 
Within phases you may skip, but skipping between phases is problematic.

### What if I get stuck?
1. Re-read the Learning Checkpoint
2. Review Examples 1-3
3. Check pattern boxes
4. Find real-world example
5. Take a break and come back

### How do I know I learned it?
You can:
- ✓ Explain WHY without looking
- ✓ Write simple examples from memory
- ✓ Know when to use vs. alternatives
- ✓ Predict output before running
- ✓ Modify code confidently
- ✓ Combine multiple topics
- ✓ Explain to someone else
